flappy-bird: An imitation of an old game

This is a game I wrote using Python, based on an old phone game that the whole world was addicted to in 2014. Most of the code in this repository uses the Pygame 
library. The bird and the pipes are written using the built-in Sprite class, allowing me to define functions to efficiently have the pipes move across the screen,
simulating movement. In addition, I was able to easily create and kill pipe objects, as they entered and exited the screen.

This game was my first introduction to the concept of game development and it gave me a simple, yet insightful look into how 2D games work.
